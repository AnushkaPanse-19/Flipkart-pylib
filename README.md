<b>Project Overview:-</b><br>
This project focuses on analyzing mobile phone data from Flipkart using Python. The primary objective is to study product distribution, ratings, discounts, and brand performance to gain insights into how different brands position themselves in the e-commerce market.
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, the notebook reveals brand-specific trends, customer sentiment through ratings, and pricing strategies through discounts. This helps uncover which brands dominate availability, how competitive their pricing is, and how customer satisfaction varies across the platform.<br><br>
